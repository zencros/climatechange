      <h1> how does climate change happen <h1>
        <h2> climate change's main cause if from man-made fossil fuels and coal, these are usually non-renewable resources. and accoring to <p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change#:~:text=Fossil%20fuels%20%E2%80%93%20coal%2C%20oil%20and,they%20trap%20the%20sun's%20heat.">un.org</a></p> coal and fossil fuels alone make up 75% of greenhouse emissions, which is causing a vast majority of area to become uninhabitable because of these greenhouse emissions making the world warmer.</h2>

        <h2> The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse gasses effect, these are gasses that although we need to live they are causeing overheating in our atmosphere. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere (greenhouse gases) act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing climate change.

        Many of these greenhouse gases occur naturally, but human activities/man-activities are increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:

        carbon dioxide (CO2)
        methane
        nitrous oxide
        fluorinated gases</h2>
